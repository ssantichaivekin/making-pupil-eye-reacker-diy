This will outline my mistakes in decasing and soldering the Microsoft HD-6000 webcam.

- I didn't have the sight size screwdriver, so I just solder thtough the plastic. This part actually work out fine. But I shouldn't do that. It's too risky.
- I took the two part of the board apart. This is because I misheard that we are keeping only the front board. This is a mistake. I should listen to this kind of instruction twice. This is the ONLY crucial mistake I made to the webcam. The webcam is otherwise fine.
- There is a small screwdriving hold in the bottom part of the webcam that I can screw out rather than soldering through.
- The camera is magnetic. It's very dangerous to solder near the camera.

How I should improve :

- Get the correct screw driver.
- Decase with patience.
- Use a small screwdriver to push up the blue circular ring (instead of soldering through it).
- Be aware that the cam is magnetic. One should TAPE the cam with a surface before doing anything, or else the cam might get attached to the soldering tip or tweezer.
- I think the real problem is that I overestimated my abilities and tried to make too much progress in one day.
