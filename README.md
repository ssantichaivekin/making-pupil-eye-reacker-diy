# We are making the pupil diy eye-tracker!

Yayyyyyy! If I can't get an interview for the eye-tracking research, why don't I build an eye-tracker myself!!!? We are following [Pupil's DIY eye-tracker][1]. (This repo will include how to make the eye-tracker itself, and also the data I obtained from it.)

Let's start with the bill of materials:

| Name | What I got | Amount |
|------|------------------------|------|
| Headset | [Pupil Headset from Shapeways.][2] | 1
| Eye cam | [Microsoft HD-6000 from Amazon.][3] | 1
| World Cam | [Logitech C615 from Amazon.][4] | 1
| IR-LED | [SFH 4050 from Digi-key][5] (turns out to be very small.) | 3 
| USB extension cable | [Amazon basic USB extension cable.][6] | 2
| Exposed (black) film negative | [LEE Filters 3x3" Infra Red #87 Infrared Polyester Filter from B&H.][7] | 1

Note that you should buy a second hand product if you can. It's much cheaper.

## Decasing the webcams

So I spent a whole day (March 11, my birthday) learning how to solder SMC circuits (by soldering a practice kit in the makerspace.) However, I still messed up the Microsoft HD-6000 webcam. The high-level reason is that I am not calm enough and I did not listen to the instruction carefully. I ended up seperating the two board in HD-6000 webcam from each other and I think it will be hard to just put it back together, so I'm ordering a new one.

Microsoft HD-6000 webcam is very hard to take apart. The instruction is not even that clear on how I should get rid of the bottom part (stand) of the webcam. It's very messy.

I did decase the other webcam (Logitech C615) sucessfully though.
