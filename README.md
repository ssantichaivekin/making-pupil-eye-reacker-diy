# We are making the pupil diy eye-tracker!

Since I cannot get an interview for HMC eye-tracking research, I decided to build an eye-tracker myself! I am following [Pupil's DIY eye-tracker][1] manual. (This repo will include how to make the eye-tracker itself, and also the data I finally obtain from it.)

Let's start with the bill of materials:

| Name | What I got | Amount |
|------|------------------------|------|
| Headset | [Pupil Headset from Shapeways.][2] | 1
| Eye cam | [Microsoft HD-6000 from Amazon.][3] | 1
| World Cam | [Logitech C615 from Amazon.][4] | 1
| IR-LED | [SFH 4050 from Digi-key][5] (turns out to be very small.) | 3 
| USB extension cable | [Amazon basic USB extension cable.][6] | 2
| Exposed (black) film negative | [LEE Filters 3x3" Infra Red #87 Infrared Polyester Filter from B&H.][7] | 1

Note that you should buy a second hand or refurbished product if you can. It's much cheaper.

## Decasing the webcams

So I spent a whole day (March 11, my birthday) learning how to solder SMC circuits (by soldering a practice kit in the HMC  makerspace.) However, I messed up the Microsoft HD-6000 webcam. The reason is that I am not calm enough and I did not take enough time to understand the instruction. I ended up seperating the two board in HD-6000 webcam from each other and I think it will be hard to just put it back together, so I'm ordering a new one.

Microsoft HD-6000 webcam is very hard to take apart. The instruction is not that clear on how I should get rid of the bottom part of the webcam. It's very messy.

I did decase the other webcam (Logitech C615) sucessfully though.

Okay, now I'm trying to decase the HD-6000 webcam again and I just noticed that the person got the two boards apart after all. This means I did not make a mistake last time I guess. I'm still confused. I guess I will have to ask someone for help.

*Update: I guess I still do not have the ability required to make a DIY eye tracker myself. I might try again next year.*
